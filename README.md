In this project, we  study using the **R programming language** the *coappearance network* of characters in the novel *Les Mis√©rables* written by *Victor Hugo*. The novel follows the lives and interactions of several characters, particularly the struggles of ex-convict Jean Valjean and his experience of redemption. In this network, *nodes* represent *characters* as indicated by the labels and *edges* connect any *pair of characters* that appear in the same chapter of the book. The values on the edges are the number of such co-appearances.

The graph is given in the txt file "*lesmis.txt*", and is visualised using the **igraph** library in **R**

This project has been done in a group of three people, at *ENSIMAG*.
