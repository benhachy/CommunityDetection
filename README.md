In this project, we  study using the R programming language the coappearance network of characters in the novel Les Mis√©rables written by Victor Hugo. The novel follows the lives and interactions of several characters, particularly the struggles of ex-convict Jean Valjean and his experience of redemption. In this network, nodes represent characters as indicated by the labels and edges connect any pair of characters that appear in the same chapter of the book. The values on the edges are the number of such co-appearances.

The graph is given in the txt file "lesmis.txt"
